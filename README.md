# libfprint-elan0c63-insecure

This is a libfprint copy with some tweaks\* and (ugly) hacks to make the fingerprint scanner actually usable.

Is it really insecure ?
Not really, so far my rates are:

- False positive (insecure) : 0%
- False negative (inconvenient) : 20%

but I've only tested this with my own fingers and device.
